There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.

Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
